Abstract:

Modernization is not a new phenomenon in the paradigm of the world’s history.  Humans are constantly in a state of adapting technology and innovation to improve products, services, and processes to better serve our own needs and habits. However, the current era, specifically IT Modernization, or the digitization of formerly analogue or manual processes, is characteristically different in pace and intention. In past modernization phases, physical labor was able to convert to a more complex and creative workforce with education. 



Following this digital transformation, workers will face a more competitive global workforce, and much fewer choices, limited between being a maker of technology (a high barrier to entry) or a maintainer of technology (mundane.) Therefore, technologists and technology leaders must use ethical modernization principles guided by a code of ethics similar to other occupations which deal with people, when embarking on digital transformation. This 

Intended Audience:

Technologists, technology leaders, policy makers, and students of technology. Though, the document extends to those who aim to be more informed consumers of technology and observers of modernization. We anticipate the document to serve as a living document which can aid in evaluating the ethical considerations and implications of IT Modernization initiatives, and will transcend specific technologies. 

Purpose:

The Code of Ethics, henceforth referred to as, “The Codes,”  to serve as a high level reference for evaluating the ethical factors of a digital modernization project, program, or policy. The Codes, are not aimed to be all encompassing or comprehensive list of moral, ethical, or legal considerations. Rather, we utilize the brevity of ethical codes as an intentional vehicle meant to be inclusive to all people; in a way that morality cannot, due to it’s relativity, and legality cannot, due to interpretations and complexity. 

The aim is to guide technologists into investing their time and energy towards eudaimonic outcomes, guided by ethics. We accept that no endeavor will be absolute, that all things exist on a scale. The final purpose of this document is to give technologists and the informed public, a tech agnostic evaluation for their undertaking in the hopes that we can harness tech talent towards the advancement of humanity, rather than degradation of the labor force.






Part A: Definitions

Ethics in Modernization


What is ethical modernization? Ethics is the consideration for the moral principles of the outcome of an activity. Modernization is the adaptation of technology and innovation to transform a product or service to serve modern needs or habits. Ethical modernization, then, is a transformation of a product or service that possesses a characterically moral outcome as the vision. 

Ethics

Ethics refers to moral principles that guide a person’s behavior or the conduct of an activity. A code of ethics describes a type of social contract. It serves as a code of expectations that unify and moderate the behaviors of thousands of human interactions. It is only sometimes written  but always felt. Ethics provides a framework of conduct where law does not address it.  As an example, recall the number of highly customized ethical codes we encounter on a daily basis. There are sometimes ethical codes written for kickball teams, preschools classrooms, chess tournaments, and homeowners associations. There will never be a law that punishes a member of the after school Chess Club of cheating. However, the Chess Club is certainly able to come up with an enforceable code of ethics, which can forbid the player from returning. Ethical codes, in turn, aim to insert moral conduct in behavior where law cannot or serve as a foundation where it applies.

Importantly, there are standards codes of ethics established in business, law, and medicine. These ethics are often managed by associations, which demand a written agreement.  When you violate an ethical agreement, there is most likely not a recourse for it, except that you can no longer associate with others who do act ethically. You are not to be trusted, and trust begets an entirely different set recourse. 

Laws

Many ethical violations do overlap with laws that were based on the ethical principle. In Medicine, enough specific violations to the Medical ethical code of “Primum no noecre,” there might be a law that follows. For example, laws the penalize doctors who over prescribe opioid pain killers. 

Laws are a system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties (Oxford). 
Laws are an output of a very tangible system. There are Local, State, and Federal Laws that  that must undergo a lengthy system of democratic procedures. There are also bureaucratic policies. There are hundreds of mechanisms to implement written rules that ensure governance of human behavior to the “correct” behavior or desired outcome of a community or society. 

Laws have the highest cost of creation. It has an extremely burdensome overhead of enforcement as well. It cannot be easily made or changed once it is made. It takes a great deal of subsequent energy to enforce law. Laws are also not a determination of morality. Laws only reflect the morality of the majority at a specific intersection of time. It means that at any point the majority becomes a minority or if time passes, the law is obsolete and irrelevant. Most laws face irrelevancy. This is the exact reason why we cannot use the breaking of a law to mean breaking of ethics or morals.


Morals

Morals are concerned with the principles of right and wrong. Human morality is the heart of the great question, “Are humans good or bad?” A question that begets, “What is good or bad?” In Western societies, we have a known basis of morality derived from Judeo-Christian values listed in the “Ten Commandments.” In Eastern societies, we have a basis around the cyclical return of goodness from karma. However, for the sake of simplicity, we can argue that most of the World’s modern societies agree that murder, stealing, greediness, lying, and cheating is immoral.We can also argue that the principle of empathy, in the form of “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” drives our unified code of morality. 

Still, while we can’t argue most of us are driven by the same morality, but we know that morality comes in a gray tinted spectrum and often fluid by circumstance. However, another undeniable event in maturity comes in the form of accepting moral ambiguity. Comprehending that not all things are good or bad, is a visible hallmark of though maturity. For example, we all know stealing is wrong, but what if your family was starving? We know murder is wrong, but what about the cases of self defense?

Likewise, morals are developed to an individual over a behemoth of childhood experiences, religious factors, and personal philosophy. Laws are developed as society’s response to repeated discord on what is both moral and ethical. When something is very egregious and immediately viewed as a non-repeatable violation of human morality and ethics, law can sometimes quickly follow. Still, for the most part, it takes a long time to make a law into address society’s needs. Nevertheless, laws are the most effective and powerful mechanisms for correcting social wrongs, preventing violations, and shaping society. 

It’s an important distinguishment that people do not disagree on morality. However, we must accept that people fundamentally disagree on the degree of mercy that society should allow at the intersection of moral violation and circumstance. This idea of mercy or tolerance for the defection of principles divides us more than the actual codes of laws, morals, or ethics.




Breaking a Code of Morality, Law, and Ethics

Cooperation is the most precise word to describe the economic arguments for why we strive to comply with codes of morals, laws, and ethics. It is much too complex to breakdown the economics of game theory on cooperation. For brevity: the award is “not bad” for defecting. The award is highest for cooperating. It is generally very difficult to make sure others cooperate, which makes it easier to defect. However, with healthy communication channels and a trustworthy leader, people believe cooperation can be achieved. People want to cooperate, if for nothing but the higher award that can be achieved. In this way, we should take a second to briefly address non-corporeal punishment lost when moral, legal, and ethical norms are broken.  


Monetary Punishment

Monetary punishments are enforced in the form of fees and fines. Our most common and trusted method of enforcing good social norms and punishing deviance is very flawed. We use money to carry out punitive transactions because it seems easy.  Yet, it is likely the most sophisticated transaction possible. I argue that cooperation and defection fall on a spectrum of dollar amounts that is far too subjective. 

The economic principle is simple: people will behave because people don’t want to lose money. But the connection from behavior to money is extremely complicated. If this form of punishment worked, people with more to lose would be more risk averse. But that is just not the case! People who have more money can afford to be much more deviant and defect on social codes of conduct. They are able to reap the low hanging fruits from the awards of defection.

In layman’s context, people who drive expensive and fast sports cars can provbably afford to pay the speeding ticket. Therefore, people who might prove the riskiest driving habits care that e least about the punishment of the risk. It’s not a comprehensive analogy, but it does effectively muddy the use of monetary damages to prevent speeding, 

Similarly, in the use of public money for public goods and services, the leap for a government official to make decisions based on the notion that a bad decision is a certain indirect loss from his own taxes is a weak argument for cooperation. 

All this is to say, other gains and punishments actually motivate people from defection. 

Legacy

When you take away corporal or monetary motivations for cooperation from people, what is actually left might  also not be too complicated. I argue that all people strive towards a legacy that reflects cooperation for human goodness by cooperating and contributing to the establish moral, ethical, and legal conduct. 

We can easily see evidence of this from the lasting act of American tycoon families: Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Morgans. Tactics used to amass an incomprehensible amount of wealth were notably unethical, definitely illegal, and arguably immoral. Regardless, they had a vision to be remembered for their philanthropy and sound moral and ethical philosophies. Today, people can hardly remember the unethical business practices they routinely engaged in because it has always been the intent that their legacy remains for human goodness. There are hundreds of charitable and philanthropic organizations dedicated to promoting tenets of human ethics and morals in their namesakes. 

The damages to legacy is both immediate and eternal. Unlike money, which can be recouped in a sense, legacy has an ambiguous recovery process. There are no set fines or incarceration. You cannot say, “I paid this fine,” or “I served the time.” Likewise, organizations who break ethical, moral, and legal codes of conduct face extended caution from their customers. 

Understanding that people are motivated by a joint or individual pursuit of legacy plays an important role in what it means to modernize ethically.








The Great Digital Modernization 

Humans have a consistent history of undergoing economic transformation through the use of technical innovations. It is also not unique that on single innovative principle changes the outcome of a million different actions. 

We are undergoing an era of The Great Digital Transformation. Organizations and Government entities all over the world are synchronized to convert their business processes into one that is managed by the use of software, hardware, and begetting a slew of emerging technologies. 

Unlike the other transformations which served to grow the wealth of the world, this one aims to capture it at the top. 

This phase of modernization will leave people poorer and less well off than other modernization efforts. 

This is happening because corporations who have the resources to capture tech talent are using it to remove their highest cost budget item: payroll. 
Technology used to replace workers is the worst use of technology.
We need strong guidance on the best use of technology-- To solve problems for people, not replace them
The misuse of technology is probably not intentional, not being human centric enough causes the default to just simply replace people instead of enhancing processes
